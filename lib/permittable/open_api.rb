module Permittable
  # Assembles OpenAPI 3.1 fragments and documents from Permittable contracts.
  # Plain Ruby over the frozen contract registry — Rails is not required; the
  # `permittable:openapi` rake task (loaded by the Railtie) supplies the
  # Rails-only parts: eager loading, controller discovery, and the route
  # descriptors that turn operations into real `paths` entries.
  #
  # Everything the exporter cannot know is left visible rather than guessed:
  # actions covered only by a catch-all rule on a host without
  # `action_methods` appear under the "*" key with `x-permittable-catch-all`,
  # and operations with no matching route — or whose path+verb slot another
  # controller already claimed, which a document cannot represent twice —
  # land in `x-permittable-controllers` instead of being dropped silently.
